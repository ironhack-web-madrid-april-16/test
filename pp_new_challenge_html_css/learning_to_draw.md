Learning to Draw

Ohhh those sweet days when you were just a toddler learning how to speak, move and draw... Remember the typical house everyone used to draw, with a tree and the Sun? Well, those days are back because now you have to learn how to draw... again.




- Create a blank web page with just html, head, body, and a style tag.
- Change the background of the page to blue. Remember the clouds and the Sun.
- Create a div for the ground - position it at the bottom and give it an appropriate height. Use a gradient to enhance grass color.
- Position a tree and a house image (we provided some images in here but feel free to use any image you may like). Try to make it look like the one we created.

EXTRA
- This amazing draw needs a signature! Create a div for your signature. Use a custom font (Google Web Fonts).
